        <p>The Solar Winter School was a week-long event that took place in Nice, France, specifically in Sophia
          Antipolis. The program was organized by the O.I.E group of MINES Paris, a leading French engineering school,
          and attracted students from all over the world who were interested in learning about solar radiation and its
          practical applications.

          The program was designed to provide students with a unique and immersive learning experience in a beautiful
          location. Sophia Antipolis, located on the French Riviera, is known for its sunny weather and stunning natural
          beauty, making it the perfect location to study solar radiation.</p>
        <p>The program, and it aimed to provide students with a
          comprehensive understanding of solar assessment and forecasting. The program covered a range of topics,
          including basics of solar radiation data, site prospecting via atlas and cadasters, in situ measurements, data
          format and dissemination, estimation models using satellites and reanalysis, and sustainable assessment of PV
          projects.</p>

        <p>The Solar Winter School program offered a range of courses and activities that provided students with a
          comprehensive understanding of solar radiation and its practical applications. Here are some of the courses
          that were covered during the program:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Basics of solar radiation data</li>
          <li>Site prospection via atlas and cadasters</li>
          <li>In situ measurements and practical work</li>
          <li>Data format and dissemination</li>
          <li>Estimation models: satellites, reanalysis, and validation</li>
          <li>Pyreliometer manufacturing and practical work</li>
          <li>Sustainable assessment of PV projects</li>
          <li>TMY is dead, long-term analysis, and calibration</li>

        <h2 style="color:#12d640">Construction of pyranometers</h2>
        <p>One of the practical workshops offered at the Solar Winter School was focused on building a homemade
          pyranometer. This was a hands-on session where students had the opportunity to learn about the principles
          behind pyranometers and how they measure solar radiation. Under the guidance of expert instructors, students
          were able to build their own pyranometers using simple and inexpensive materials. This activity provided a
          valuable opportunity for students to gain practical experience with the equipment and techniques used in solar
          radiation measurement.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#12d640">Libinsitu</h2>
        <p>Libinsitu is a library that facilitates the conversion of solar in situ data to a standard NetCDF format to
          improve standardization and interoperability. This open-source library provides a set of command-line
          interface (CLI) utilities and Python functions that can transform raw input files into NetCDF format, explore
          and query NetCDF files, flag data with quality checks, produce graphs for visual quality control, and
          transform data into various formats like CSV, JSON, text, and pandas Dataframes. It also proposes a convention
          for solar data on top of CF conventions and includes a set of formatted and enriched metadata for several
          networks and their stations. Additionally, input data for many networks are processed and made available
          through a Thredds data server and a web interface.</p>
